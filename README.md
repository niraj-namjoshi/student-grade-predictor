The objective of this project was to create an advanced student grade predictor by leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on decision trees through the robust scikit-learn package.

The data preprocessing involved was carefully curated to deal with skewed dataset, and the model was trained using the most relevant data and further tuned to enhance accuracy based on test and cross validation data.

To connect the model with a user-friendly frontend, an advanced web framework, Flask, was deployed. The project's data source was the prestigious UCI student repository, and it aimed to accurately predict student grades based on various parameters.
